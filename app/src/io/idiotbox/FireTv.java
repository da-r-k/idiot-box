 * Amazon Fire TV (Fire OS 6, 7 and 8, Android 7.1, 9 and 11; tested on a Fire TV Stick 3rd gen, AFTSSS, and an AFTMM
 * on Fire OS 6.7.1.1). Fire OS protects its launcher (pm disable-user refuses it) and ignores set-home-activity, so our
 * home screen can't be the HOME activity there. Instead FireTvService opens it whenever Amazon's home screen comes to
 * the front, and LiveTvActivity turns the remote's Live TV button into a straight way home. Fire OS 6 refuses
 * third-party accessibility services, so there FireTvKeeper does the same job through UsageStats and moveTaskToFront.
