 *    the top right, the weather, the time, what's playing and the round buttons (Refresh, Settings);
 *  - the focused title over its own photo (the hero), and the tab's row of cards under it (Live TV and Music add a row
 *    of pills between them);
 *  - at the bottom, the apps: small icons that grow into cards when they have focus (the titles shrink to make room);
 *  - ↓ on the apps: everything moves up and the bottom drawer (the inputs) appears; ↑ or Back closes it;
 *  - All Apps: a sheet over everything.
 * Measurements are in a 1920×1080 space (k = width / 1920). The screen is split into views so a change only records
 * again the one it touches.
